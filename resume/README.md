# Manpreet Kaur . Jarvis Consulting

I recently graduated from Humber College where I completed a Post-Graduate Certificate in Information Technology Solutions. Prior to pursuing a career in information technology, I was able to gain work experience as an I.T. Process Consultant where I utilized my strengths and skillsets in service management. This professional experience empowered me to pursue a career in information technology solutions. As a result, my career path has led me to pursue an opportunity and work as an Associate Data Engineer at Jarvis Consulting. Additionally, when I'm not working, I am also passionate about music, building software and all things vegetarian food. I also love playing sports, especially volleyball which enables me to utilize my passion for social interactions and teamwork. Going forward, I aim to enhance my skills as IT professional and grow my network.

## Development Projects
Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_manpreet/](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_manpreet/)

-   **Linux & SQL**: Developed Linux and SQL application that needed to record the hardware specifications of each node and monitor node resource usages in real-time . The collected data was stored in an RDBMS database. Data was used to generate some reports for future resource planning purposes and to use those scripts for future projects.

-   **Core Java Apps**: Developed 3 Java applications under this project. i.e. Grep App, JDBC App and Twitter CLI App. _Grep Application_  performs the functionality of grep command in Linux. It recursively searches all the files in a given directory and outputs all the lines that matches the regex pattern in a specified output file. _JDBC application_ demonstrates the use of one of the most fundamental and frequently used Java libraries like JDBC by connecting with PostgreSQL and made amendments in the tables using CRUD operations. _Twitter CLI Application_ allows users to post, delete and view tweets without having access to twitter on web browser or mobile application. Rather, user can perform these operations on tweets by sending GET and POST requests on several twitter REST API resource endpoints.

-   **SpringBoot App**: Developed a new trading platform which uses 3-tier Architecture to replace the legacy system which is a monolithic application that is hard to scale and manage. It is a simulation trading application built using Java SpringBoot framework where traders can buy and sell the products. This application can be accessed by consuming REST API through web browser via swagger or by other open source applications like postman.

-   **Hadoop:** Developed this project to analyze the data provided by 'World development Indicator' using Hive feature of Hadoop. I was able to connect with hive server via zeppelin notebook or also by CLI using beeline. Also, used Hadoop cluster of 3 nodes using GPC Dataproc which is managed by YARN.

-   **Spark/Scala**: Completed Spark/Scala project that processes data using Apache Spark and Scala. There are two Zeppelin notebooks that perform data processing on Online Retail dataset using RDDs and Structured APIs. I used Spark/Scala to analyze retail dataset. Using this dataset, I performed basic analysis through questionnaire on this dataset using RDDs and Structured APIs.

-   **Clou****d & Dev****Ops:** `In progress` Deploying my Springboot application over AWS cloud using its capabilities like Auto scaling, load balancers, Elastic beanstalk etc.
